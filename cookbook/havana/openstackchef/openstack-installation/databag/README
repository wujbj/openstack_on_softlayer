Added support for creating encrypted passwords in databags

Run script ./prep_bag_dev.sg to create data bag for OpenStack DB related passwords. The passwords are defined in dev/passwords.json file

If running in production, do not define passwords in that file. Instead, generate them automatically. E.g.,

def secure_password
  pw = String.new
  while pw.length < 20
    pw << ::OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(1).gsub(/\W/, '')
  end
  pw
end
